      <p>
        PromptHealth offers different memberships and features as listed on the site and reserves the right to change what we offer under different subscriptions from time to time. Any changes to subscription will be posted on site with a reasonable notice.
        Our Service is billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
        At the end of each Billing Cycle, your subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or PromptHealth Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through your online account management in your dashboard with 30 day notice. PromptHealth Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. We will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective. Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
        Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable. Payment for any on-going services is billed automatically until notification that you would like to terminate your access to the services.
        When you provide a payment instrument to us, you confirm that you are permitted to use that payment instrument. When you make a payment, you authorize us (and our designated payment processor) to charge the full amount to the payment instrument you designate for the transaction. You also authorize us to collect and store that funding instrument, along with other related transaction information.
        If you pay by credit, we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for an amount as high as the full price. If you cancel a transaction before completion, this pre-approval may result in those funds not otherwise being immediately available to you.
        We may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these Terms, or if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss. In order to prevent financial loss to you or to us, we may contact your funding instrument issuer, law enforcement, or affected third parties (including other users) and share details of any payments you are associated with, if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or a violation of law.

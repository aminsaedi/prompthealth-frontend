BEFORE USE, YOU MUST DO FOLLOWING

  DELETE ALL COLOR SETTING IN CSS FILE FOR BETTER USE CASE.
  you can use this regEx to delete all color setting 
  ^\s*color:\s.+;\s*\n

  MAKE SURE pin-filled EXISTS (IT'S USED IN SEARCH BAR)
  CURRENTLY I CREATED THE ICON MANUALLY EDITING STYLE.CSS
  (so if you update the iconset, it will be desappeared)


AND THEN YOU CAN USE CUSOME DIRECTIVE [iconPh]
ex) <i class="icon-chevron-right text-danger" iconPh></i>






Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in desktop programs, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in demo.html. The character inside this text box may be invisible; but it can still be copied. See this guide for more info: https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.
